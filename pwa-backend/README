The pom.xml is using the new appengine-maven-plugin based on Google Cloud SDK

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/tools/using-maven

If you haven't installed the sdk in one of the "customary location"[1] you need

export GOOGLE_CLOUD_SDK_HOME=/path/to

before run

mvn appengine:whatever
